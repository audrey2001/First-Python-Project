# First-Python-Project
The project asks for user input(enter any number!) and then produces half the length of the inputted number then completes the rest with a '*' sign and on the next line uses '*' to fill half the length of the inputted number while the other half of the inputted number comes next
eg a user enters 123456
the result shows:123***
                    ***456
Note; number of '*' = total length of inputted number
